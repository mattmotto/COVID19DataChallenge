## Empirical Visualization
Using [NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Incident Command System for COVID-19 Response Data](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data), we compiled the source data to determine the rate of spread in each of NYC's zipcodes. 

Outerboroughs tends to have faster rates of spread than than Manhattan implying there may be underlying contribute to disproportional rates in these communities.

## Simulated Data
Using a basic SIR model, we generated a stochoastic model of the infection's spread. We utilized this model to discern what the R-naught *(the number of new infections estimated to stem from a single case)* would be in a stochastic scenario. 

## City Similarity Metric
While NYC is currrently at the epicenter of the epidemic, COVID-19 can be expected to spread to our cities in the United States. We sought to figure out which other cities would also be heavily impacted by an outbreak by comparing inequality attributes between cities. Our intuition came from the paper, ["Mobility, Economic Opportunity and New York City Neighborhoodsand New York City Neighborhoods"](https://wagner.nyu.edu/files/faculty/publications/JobAccessNov2015.pdf) from **The Rudin Center for Transportation at the NYU Wagner School** which led us to to believe a communities' access to public transportation would impact COVID-19's spread rate. We selected *(Chicago and Los Angeles)* as susceptible cities given their similar urban environment to New York City. We compiled transportation data for these cities and correlated NYC zipcodes to LA neighborhoods. 

## Population Data Model
Given the infection's spread throughout NYC and the abundance of publicly available, we developed a XGBoost machine learning model to understand which features played a non-neglible role in the infection rate of a zipcode. We gathered features from various modalities including **Census, Demographic, Social, Economic, and Housing** from ["NYC Planning Population FactFinder"](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-factfinder) (in total 1300+ features for 119 zipcodes). Our target was the average rate of change in positive COVID19 cases for each zipcode.

We believe a **population data** model will be crucial in understanding why COVID-19 differentially impacts certain communities, specifically low-income and minority communities. 

To create explore the code for the model and the preprocessing utilized, check out **population_data_model.ipynb.ipynb** in our [**model branch**](https://github.com/mattmotto/COVID19DataChallenge/tree/model). 

Our accomplishments and next steps with the model:

 1. *Curated Population Data*: We pulled down data files for each **Neighborhood Tabulation Area** and mapped NTAs to **Zipcodes**, allowing for further research into how varying population features can account for COVID's differential impact. 
 2. *Dimensionality Reduction / Feature Selection*: We suggest that feature selection be employed using L1 regularization (Lasso) and recursive feature removal to reduce the feature space and create a more parsimonious model
 3. *Aggregating Categories of Features*: Each of the 1300+ features is associated with a `category` such as `sex_and_age` and `occupation`, thus a further explorations of this model should these features together to theoretically strengthen the correlation. 
 4. *Models for each Modality*: Given the five existing modalities, `Census`, `Demographic`, `Social`, `Economic`, and `Housing`  a model should be attempted to be created for each of them instead of the current *all-in-one* in order to elucidate important features in modality.
