## Empirical Visualization
Using [NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Incident Command System for COVID-19 Response Data](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data), we compiled the source data to determine the rate of spread in each of NYC's zipcodes. 

Outerboroughs tends to have faster rates of spread than than Manhattan implying there may be underlying contribute to disproportional rates in these communities.

## Simulated Data
Using a basic SIR model, we generated a stochoastic model of the infection's spread. We utilized this model to discern what the R-naught *(the number of new infections estimated to stem from a single case)* would be in a stochastic scenario. 

## City Similarity Metric
While NYC is currrently at the epicenter of the epidemic, COVID-19 can be expected to spread to our cities in the United States. We sought to figure out which other cities would also be heavily impacted by an outbreak by comparing inequality attributes between cities. Our intuition came from the paper, ["Mobility, Economic Opportunity and New York City Neighborhoodsand New York City Neighborhoods"](https://wagner.nyu.edu/files/faculty/publications/JobAccessNov2015.pdf) from **The Rudin Center for Transportation at the NYU Wagner School** which led us to to believe a communities' access to public transportation would impact COVID-19's spread rate. We selected *(Chicago and Los Angeles)* as susceptible cities given their similar urban environment to New York City. We compiled transportation data for these cities and correlated NYC zipcodes to LA neighborhoods. 

## Demographic Model
Given the infection's spread throughout NYC and the abundance of publicly available, we developed a XGBOOST machine learning model to understand which features played a non-neglible role in the infection rate of a zipcode. We gathered features from various modalities including **Census, Demographic, Social, Economic, and Housing** from ["NYC Planning Population Face Finder"](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) (in total 1300+ features).
